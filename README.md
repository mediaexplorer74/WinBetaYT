# WinBeta_Videos

My fork of Dominic Maas' winbeta-video project for some micro-RnD

## About
The original WinBeta Video is a very simple Windows 10 app that displays and plays YouTube videos from the WinBeta YouTube channel.
WinBeta Video requires the YouTube .NET API, and both MyToolkit and MyToolkit Extended (For playing YouTube Videos)
