## About
The original WinBeta_Video is a very simple Windows 10 app that displays and plays YouTube videos 
from the WinBeta YouTube channel.
WinBeta Video requires the YouTube .NET API, and both MyToolkit and MyToolkit Extended (For playing YouTube Videos).
So, I'll try to fix all "Video not playing" issues.


## Status
- Damaged. No video playing, sadly. Only WinBeta channel video list ok.


## Tech moments
- UWP
- Win. SDK build: 19041 
- Min. Win. SDK build: 10240 


## To Do
* fix myToolkit.Extended bugs after "min. w10m sdk downshifting"

## ..

As is. No support. RnD only
